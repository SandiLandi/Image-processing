# Image Processing Projects 🧠📷

This repository contains a collection of labs and a final project focused on image processing using Python. The code demonstrates practical applications of image filtering, segmentation, enhancement, and analysis, mainly using libraries such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-image`, `scipy`, and `nibabel`.

## 📁 Structure

- **Lab1–Lab5**: Each lab contains sample image processing tasks, including:
  - grayscale and color space conversion
  - histogram equalization
  - edge detection
  - morphological operations
  - region labeling and filtering
- **Final Project**:  
  A complete image segmentation and analysis pipeline using real medical data in `.nii.gz` format.  
  The script:
  - loads and preprocesses the data
  - applies intensity filtering and morphological cleanup
  - performs segmentation based on geometrical features
  - visualizes and saves output

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- nibabel
- Jupyter Notebook
